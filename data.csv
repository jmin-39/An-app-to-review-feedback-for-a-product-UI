STAR,FEEDBACK
5,Tighten up
1,The excuse that the delivery was late was because the restaurant was late in cooking.
5,BGETS
1,"i’ve spent thousands and thousands of dollars through this app over the years, but the customer service is racist and bizarre. an offensive waste of time"
5,"Coupang Eats Ta Donne says it’s inconvenient! But in my neighborhood, Coupang Eats is the best bag haha."
5,Very professional delivery service and delivery charge was so cheap.
5,"I think this app is definitely more delivery friendly for English speakers in comparison to other ones. I like that the delivery drivers, that I’ve had so far, have arrived in a car instead of those crazy motorcycles. Great service!"
4,"Fast, cheap and versatile"
1,"The app has locked me out of my account after updating. For more than 6 months I cannot access my account because it asks me for the “name” I typed in. I have no idea what I typed. Nothing works. Can’t use the same “email a password to a user” that the rest of the world uses. No, coupang is special, so we have to remember whatever stupid name we typed when we made the account or the app becomes useless."
5,value for money
5,Coupang is the fastest.
1,"Please add confirmation step before purchase. You know once customer order, it is almost impossible to cancel order. Last time I just wanted to check discount applying correctly but unlike other food delivery service, there were no order confirmation step and I should have to purchase menu which I have never wanted. I even called customer service & diner immediately but they refused to cancel.

If order procedure is highly impossible to cancel, there should be confirmation step before purchase."
5,"For ordering food in Korea, especially as a foreigner, there’s nothing better. The only bad things are on the end of the restaurants, which is just bound to happen from time to time. I made the switch from Yogiyo ages ago and I’ve never looked back."
5,"I don't usually like pig's feet.
The pig's feet here are very good!!!

I ate nothing left."
5,Coupang Eats is a MUST have app for expats living in Korea. English translation for menus is always growing. The app is rock-solid and support has been quick and easy if there is an order or delivery problem.
2,Recently the app has had trouble connecting orders to delivery partners or the order times will become significantly delayed. This doesn’t happen when ordering the same menu from other apps. Needs to be addressed.
5,It's sweet and spicy and delicious.
1,"This is a terrible food delivery service!!!! 4 times in a week I had my order delayed for two or three hours, and I had to refuse it. this is a terrible service"
1,"If phone number verification is not possible, there must be another verification method. Phone number verification is frustrating with all three payment methods."
3,App is great but lacking English Language
1,Worst
1,"i saw the recent incident calling women “pussy” and what not. Those comments were purely sexist, disrespectful and out of date. Whoever wrote it and confirmed it both should be suspended at least. do educate your team better. such a shame, i really found the app to be useful."
1,YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS APP
1,"The app is very convenient and good, but the customer service center only has phone calls or emails, but they don't answer the phone, so it's very difficult to connect, and emails go unanswered even after a few days. We need a chat service like Baemin."
1,"Misogyny company
Be Shameful"
3,"It's nice that they support English, but the menus are a bit strange in English. I wish I could set the language within the app."
5,It would be perfect if you added dark mode!!!
5,I really enjoyed the meal
5,Excellent!!!
1,"The service is a frog. The delivery driver didn't look at the request line and started banging on the door, swearing, and throwing the food. But the customer service center apologized for not being able to help. It played on repeat hahahahaha. It's a delivery app, but I'm an anorexic person. Just looking at food makes me throw up and get sick."
3,"It's a chronic problem.
Always delay the expected delivery time little by little.
It's Cheetah Delivery and it puts it to shame.
Not once or twice, but almost every time
I can't express it other than commercialism haha.
There’s a chronic issue of this app alwaysssss delaying the estimated delivery time. Why are they putting forward ‘Cheetah delivery’ in the first place when they change the time gradually EVERY SINGLE TIME?!"
1,They don’t allow account deletion. They only tell you to delete the app as you can’t delete Coupang Eats account separately. But I never signed up for Coupang so I don’t know what’s going on. Suspect privacy policy.
5,Please link it to Apple Watch!
2,Please support iPad landscape mode
5,"I'm not good at Korean, so I write in English.

I’m a foreigner living in Korea who has been ordering delivery for years. I used to use a different app but switched over to coupang eats because of the menu layout and speedy delivery. My only complaints are how there isn't a language setting for the app because even though my phone language is set in English I would like to read the menu items in Korean so I know exactly what I'm ordering(sometimes the translations are off ). The only way I can read the menu items in Korean is to change my phone language to Korean which is a bit inconvenient. Also recently they changed the disposable utensil option so you have to remember to request it which I have forgotten to do like 10 times now since I’m so used to not having to request it for YEARS. I had to eat my cake and scone today with wooden chopsticks that I found which triggered me to write this review lol. Please at least make it a yes or no option instead of an automatic no if you don’t check the box. My Korean friends also complained about this and constantly forgot to request it as well when we ordered delivery."
3,"The app runs very well and it’s perhaps the most foreigner-friendly food delivery app in Korea. Over a year of using it without any problem.

Last week however, a delivery partner claimed that he/she had delivered my order when they did not, and when I contacted Coupang Eats Customer Service Center, they accused me of being at fault, pretty much saying that the delivery person had done the delivery when they did not. I had two additional orders that same night, without any issue

Three days later, I am still waiting for my refund. Don’t ruin the app because of poor customer service."
5,Thank you for the prompt delivery!
1,"I don’t recommend order foods from immoral company, Coupang."
5,Please enable the search function in order history.
1,"This was working great when I first started using it a couple weeks ago. I tried multiple times to order dinner at work but it just keeps crashing. Totally unacceptable.

Update: Still crashing... on TWO devices (iphone and ipad) i am downgrading this review to one star. What a huge disappointment."
1,"You'll get real cancer. If a car is caught, the delay increases twice as much as the default one hour. One time, they kept circling around the store and suddenly canceled the pick-up. (If they couldn't find the store, they canceled it in advance, or did they cancel after walking around the same place for 15 minutes?) Then, after about 5 minutes, they suddenly showed up far away. Another person reapplied and received the food in an hour and a half. Thinking I might have been unlucky that day, I ordered it today, but it was dispatched 20 minutes away from the store, so I went to the restaurant to pick it up, and it took an hour to get back home. Delivery was delayed for the first 30 minutes, then 40 minutes, and then another hour. The tteokbokki swelled and the chicken cooled down. They said they would only deliver to one house at a time, but it always took longer than Baemin."
5,good
1,"Inconvenient app for developers
The worst delivery app I've ever tried
The delivery fee is expensive compared to other delivery apps, so I had a reasonable suspicion that the restaurants were trying to raise the delivery fee because they were pressured to lower the food price compared to other places (when I combined the places I ordered from, Coupang Eats was about 1,000 won more expensive).

Coupang’s corporate image is also not good.
If I use up all the promotional coupons, I don't think I'll ever use them again."
5,"Let’s you know when order goes through to the restaurant, then the delivery courier picks the food up from the restaurant and when it is delivered. Knowledge is power and info is disseminated very well by this company!"
1,"Coupang eats recently lowered minimum fee paid to delivery riders from 3200won to 2500won which is around 30% drop. This service does not protect the employees at all. Amazingly, the riders do not get any insurance and have to pay for any damages that may occur during work. Plz boycott this company"
1,"I went in to get my first order coupon.
I'm out of coupons... are you kidding me? Delete immediately"
4,"The app itself is really fast and convenient to use. I’d say it’s the best designed food delivery app in South Korea. Delivery is usually excellent as well, especially the “Cheetah” delivery. In some cases the delivery fee can be a little too high and there isn’t a really large selection of restaurants or cafes yet. So overall it’s about 4 stars (probably 5 stars in the future)."
5,Hi-Hi
1,"I was in love with this app and never had a complaint until recently. I used to have so many food options but for the past two weeks, about 80% of previous food places are now labeled unavailable to my area.....These are places I've been ordering from for the past year so I am Very confused about what happened. And they all happened at once. It wasn’t a gradual loss of available options."
5,"Even if it doesn't work, it's good that it was delivered"
